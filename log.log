Warning: Your compiler doesn't support incremental linking and lto at the same time, so lto is being disabled. To force lto on anyway, use the --force-lto option. That will disable partial linking.
Warning: Protocol buffer compiler (protoc) not found.
         Please install protobuf-compiler for tracing support.
