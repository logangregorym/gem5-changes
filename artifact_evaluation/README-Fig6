This document contains instructions for reproducing the main results found in figure 6

In order to reproduce figure 6 we will need to run 2 sets of simulations on the SPEC2017 benchmark suite. The first set of results will require the user to be on the "SCC" (default) branch, and the second the "RAW-with-LVP" branch.

To reproduce the first set of results which represents full spoeculative code compaction please do the following:
1) Ensure that you are on the SCC branch
2) Run scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j 32 from within the "gem5-changes" directory
3) Ensure that the variables at the top of ./spec_checkpoint_script_generator_super.sh are set appropiately
4) Run ./spec_checkpoint_script_generator_super.sh which will generate ./gem5_sim_run_all_artifact_evaluation_super.sh
5) Run ./gem5_sim_run_all_artifact_evaluation_super.sh
6) Wait for the runs to complete, should take 3-6 hours. Status can be checked by runing "squeue -u <username>"

Once the first set of results is generated, please checkout the "Raw-with-LVP" branch and reopen this same file for further instructions
