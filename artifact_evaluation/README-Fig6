This document contains instructions for reproducing the main results found in figure 6

In order to reproduce figure 6 we will need to run 2 sets of simulations on the SPEC2017 benchmark suite. The first set of results will require the user to be on the "SCC" (default) branch, and the second the "RAW-with-LVP" branch.

To reproduce the second set of results which represents full spoeculative code compaction please do the following:
1) Ensure that you are on the Raw-with-LVP branch
2) Run scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j 32 from within the "gem5-changes" directory
3) Ensure that the variables at the top of ./spec_checkpoint_script_generator_lvpraw.sh are set appropiately
4) Run ./spec_checkpoint_script_generator_lvpraw.sh which will generate ./gem5_sim_run_all_artifact_evaluation_lvpraw.sh
5) Run ./gem5_sim_run_all_artifact_evaluation_lvpraw.sh
6) Wait for the runs to complete, should take 3-6 hours. Status can be checked by runing "squeue -u <username>"
7) Once all runs have finished, check if they ran correctly by running "./check_all_simpoints.sh <type>"
8) If the script prints any slurm files go to that directory and restart the simulation by running "sbatch <file_name>"
9) Repeat steps 6-8 until the check_all_simpoints.sh script prints no slurm files


Once the second set of results is generated, continue to "README-Fig8"

Additional information about results generated:
The stats files for each simpoint can be found in /p/csd/SPEC2017/benchspec/CPU/<benchmark_name>/run/<benchmark_name>_run_ref/m5out_sim_<benchmark_name>_<type>_<simpoint_number>/stats.txt
We use the "sim_ops" stat for instruction count and "system.switch_cpus.numCycles" stat for cycle count
