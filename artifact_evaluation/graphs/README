This document describes how to recreate the figure 6 and 8 graphs. In order for these steps to work, please ensure that all results have been generated as described in "../README-Fig6" and "../README-Fig8".

1) Execute "module load python3"
2) Open "fetch_results.sh" and replace "artifact_evaluation_super" and "artifact_evaluation_lvpraw" with they type tags you used in your slurm scripts
3) Execute "./fetch_results.sh"
4) Open plot_result.py and replace "artifact_evaluation_super" and "artifact_evaluation_lvpraw" with they type tags you used in your slurm scripts
5) Execute "python3 plot_result.py"
6) If python3 says it is missing a package, you should be able to install it using "pig2 <package_name>"
7) Once the script completes, the graphs can be found in ./results/

Thank you for your help in reproducing our results! Please contact the authors if you run into any issues.
