This document contains instructions for reproducing the main results found in figure 8

In order to reproduce figure 8 we will need to run 2 sets of simulations on the SPEC2017 benchmark suite. The first set of results will require the user to be on the "SCC" (default) branch, and the second the "RAW-with-LVP" branch. Once those simulations are complete (which they will be after genrerating figure 6) we need to run McPAT on the results to analyze power"

To reproduce the power results found in figure 8:
1) Ensure that you have genrerated all results for figure 6
2) Ensure that the variables at the top of ./check_all_power_spec.sh are set appropiately
3) Run ./check_all_power_spec.sh > check_power_spec.out
4) Numerical power results can be found in "check_power_spec.out"
